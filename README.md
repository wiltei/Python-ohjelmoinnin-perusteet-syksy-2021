# Quick Monster Generator for (old) Runequest 1.0

This is my end project and -showing of of what I learned on Polytechnic Uni course, which was actually Codeacademy/Python Institute course.  
The short code is designed to generate a character for an rpg in terminal UI.  
For those interested, the game system is RuneQuest 3rd edition (1984) with Wiltsun Rune Quest (WRQ) quirks from 2020.  
Program has simple interface to choose what to do. Currently only available races are basic human and my gameworld's WoW-kind Orcs.
Newly created character stats and calculated values are then appended to a simple .txt for easy access.  
  
User can generate as many charactes as he wants to.
